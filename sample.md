## This is a test

This is an example of **Markdown**.
And here you can see a cite to *kernighan1988c*.

## Code chunks

A _paragraph_ here. A code chunk below (remember the three backticks):

```{r}
1+1
.4-.7+.3 # what? it is not zero!
```

## Graphics

It is easy.

```{r dev='pdf'}
plot(1:10)
hist(rnorm(1000))
```
